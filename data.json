  "about": "I am an undergraduate student pursuing a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering at IIITDM Jabalpur, with a strong focus on computer science and software development. I actively practice Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ through competitive programming, which has strengthened my problem-solving skills and analytical thinking. Alongside this, I work as a frontend developer using HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, and I am currently learning backend development to build full-stack applications. I also have a keen interest in AI and Machine Learning, with hands-on experience in basic ML concepts and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and OpenCV. My background in ECE allows me to approach problems with a blend of hardware understanding and software engineering principles, and I am driven by continuous learning and building efficient, real-world solutions.",
