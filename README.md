## 📌 About the Project

This portfolio is designed as a **single-page, scrollable web application** with a clean dark UI, subtle animations, and data-driven content.  
The key idea behind this project is **easy future updates** — most content is managed via a JSON file, so new projects, skills, or achievements can be added without modifying the core HTML or JavaScript.
